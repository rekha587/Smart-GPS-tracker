# Smart-GPS-tracker
## Smart GPS tracker using Arduino, GSM module and GPS module

This project enables the third party for tracking the location of any person, vehicle or other objects. This is an effective method for tracking people as well as theft control in terms of any vehicle or other equipment and as spy equipment. It also comes handy during disasters to keep track of victims. The proposed trackers make good use of a popular technology that enables communication between a Smartphone and the tracker. It will also play a significant role in the transportation system as passengers can see the real time of arriving busses or trains or airplanes at the platforms on LCD or on mobiles.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
•	Arduino Uno
•	GPS module
•	GSM module
•	ESP8266 Wifi-module
•	Jumper wires


## SIMULATION TOOLS USED:
•	PROTEUS professional 

## TECHNOLOGY USED: 
•	Cloud computing
•	Thingspeak: is an open-source Internet of Things application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP
•	Arduino code: C language

## MODULES USED: 
•	Circuit Integration: The required circuit consists of two modules.
Tracking: This module enables the user to keep track of the person/object with the tracker. The GPS module extracts the latitude and longitude of the current location.

Display: GSM module helps in communication and enables us to receive the coordinates on the tracked location on the LCD as well as our mobile phone.

•	Arduino Coding: Arduino acts as an interface between GPS and GSM. In this phase, the code for the Arduino is developed.
•	Simulation: All the required components are connected. The libraries necessary for simulation of GPS and Arduino are downloaded. The hex files are loaded and coordinates are extracted from the virtual terminal.
